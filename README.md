# Pygame-Minesweeper-Game
A Minesweeper game coded with python and Pygame.

This was mainly coded for class, but I have touched up on it a bit.
I will comment and make the code neater at some time in the future.
In order to run the game, you need to execute the MineSweeperMain.py file in the same folder as MineSweeperLogic.
